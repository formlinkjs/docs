# Formlink | API Reference

Documentation related to the API can be found [https://formlinkjs.com](https://formlinkjs.com) (not available yet).

Since working with forms is so common, especially in frameworks like Vue, React, and Svelte. Formlink is a form helper library designed to help reduce the amount of boilerplate code needed for handling typical form submissions. It is designed to be framework-agnostic and can be used with any framework or library. It allows for an explicit way to set the serialization of the form data and provides a way to handle form submission errors. When uploading a file for instance, it is usual to have to convert the object into a formdata object by passing a transformer to [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) config it's always been a lot of boilerplate code for something that could be handled by the form abstraction and so this library was born.
