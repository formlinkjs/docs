# HTTP Options

This API reference guide provides detailed information on the `HttpOptions` type and its properties for configuring HTTP request behavior in your application.

## HTTP Options Type: `HttpOptions`

`HttpOptions` is a type definition used to configure various options for making HTTP requests in your application.

## Properties

1. `withCredentials`
   - Type: `boolean`
   - Default: `false`
   - Description: Determines if cross-site Access-Control requests should be made using credentials. When set to `true`, the browser includes credentials like cookies and HTTP authentication information in the request.

2. `responseType`
   - Type: `Http.DEFAULT_RESPONSE_TYPE | string`
   - Default: `"json"`
   - Description: Specifies the default response type for HTTP requests. It controls how the response data is interpreted. The default value is `"json"` which expects JSON data, but you can specify other types such as `"text"` or `"document"`.

3. `responseEncoding`
   - Type: `Http.DEFAULT_RESPONSE_ENCODING | string`
   - Default: `"utf8"`
   - Description: Sets the default response encoding for HTTP requests. This property determines how text responses are decoded. The default value is `"utf8"`, but you can specify other encodings if needed.

4. `xsrfCookieName`
   - Type: `Http.XSRF_COOKIE_NAME | string`
   - Default: `"XSRF-TOKEN"`
   - Description: Specifies the name of the cookie to use for Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF) protection. XSRF cookies help prevent cross-site request forgery attacks.

5. `xsrfHeaderName`
   - Type: `Http.XSRF_HEADER_NAME | string`
   - Default: `"X-XSRF-TOKEN"`
   - Description: Sets the name of the header to use for Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF) protection. This header is typically included in HTTP requests to transmit XSRF tokens.

6. `maxRedirects`
   - Type: `number`
   - Default: `21`
   - Description: Specifies the maximum number of redirects to follow for an HTTP request. When a server responds with a redirect, the client can choose to follow it up to this maximum limit.

7. `baseUrl`
   - Type: `string`
   - Default: `undefined`
   - Description: Defines the base URL to use for all HTTP requests. When specified, this base URL is prepended to all relative URLs in the requests.

## Summary

The `HttpOptions` type offers a range of configuration options to control the behavior of your application's HTTP requests. You can fine-tune settings related to credentials, response type, encoding, XSRF protection, maximum redirects, and the base URL for all requests, ensuring that your HTTP requests align with your application's requirements and security considerations.
