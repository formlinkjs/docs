# ErrorObject API Reference

This API reference guide provides detailed information on the `ErrorObject` type and its properties, which are used to represent individual error objects in your application.

## ErrorObject Type: `ErrorObject`

`ErrorObject` is a type definition used to represent individual error objects in your application. Each `ErrorObject` contains information about a specific error, including the field to which it belongs and a detailed description of the error.

## Properties

1. `field`
   - Type: `string`
   - Description: Specifies the field or input element to which the error pertains. This field serves as a reference to identify where the error occurred in your application.

2. `message`
   - Type: `string|string[]`
   - Description: Provides a detailed description of the error. This property can be either a single string or an array of strings. The message(s) describe the nature and cause of the error, offering information for error handling and user feedback.

## Usage

The `ErrorObject` type is commonly used in error handling scenarios to represent specific errors associated with form fields or other components in your application. You can create an array of `ErrorObject` instances to capture multiple errors, associating each error with a particular field.

Here's an example of how you might use `ErrorObject`:

```typescript
const error: ErrorObject = {
    field: "email",
    message: "The email field is required.",
};
```

In this example, `error` represents an error associated with the "email" field, with a message indicating that the field is required. You can create multiple `ErrorObject` instances to handle various errors in your application.

## Summary

The `ErrorObject` type is a fundamental building block for handling and representing errors in your application. It allows you to structure error information in a way that is easy to work with, making it essential for error reporting and user feedback in your software.
